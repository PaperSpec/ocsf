    notes: "Add the absinthe to a chilled old-fashioned class. Roll the glass around to coat the interior of the glass and shake out any excess liquid. Combine the whiskey, simple syrup, and bitters in a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir until chilled and strain into the prepared glass. When it comes to the dilemma of express and discard or leave in the lemon peel, Elford is a \"leave in\" guy, so garnish with a neatly manicured lemon twist."
